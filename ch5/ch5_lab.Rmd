Setting up the training set. 392 is just a random number that ISL came up with and we are only taking half of it.
```{r}
set.seed(1)

train <- sample(392, 196)
test <- (-train)
```

```{r}
lm_fit <- lm(mpg~horsepower, Auto, subset=train)

summary(lm_fit)
```

```{r}
pred <- predict(lm_fit, newx=test)

mean((test[,'mpg'] - pred)^2)
```



```{r}
mpg <- Auto[test]
mpg
```
