##4.6.2
```{r}
glm_fits <- glm(Direction~.-Year-Today, Smarket, family=binomial)
summary(glm_fits)
coef(glm_fits)
```

Creating the prediction for based on the glm we created. We create a vector that is length $n$ of "Down". If the prob is greater than 0.5 we set the corresponding glm_pred[i] to "Up"
```{r}
glm_probs <- predict(glm_fits, type='response')
glm_probs[1:10]

glm_pred <- rep('Down', 1250)
glm_pred[glm_probs>0.5] = 'Up'
```

```{r}
table(glm_pred, Direction)

#These yield the same value.
(145+507)/1250
mean(Direction == glm_pred)
```

```{r}

```


```{r}
glm_fits2 <- glm(Direction~Lag1+Lag2, Smarket, family=binomial, subset=train)
```
